# What is this repository for? #

## Update ##
This repository will be archived and will likely be revisited later this year. I will be looking to integrate these control schemes with 
Unity's new Havok Physics based infrastructure. The source code is of course free to look for reference and learning. :smiley:

## Archived ##

This repository contains the implementation of an arcade vehicle controller using Unity's Entity 
Component System. The project is currently extracted from my own personal game I'm working on 
and because I'm pleased with the results of the controller - I'm deciding to open source it!

The project is still early and I do intend to refactor how systems interact with the data.

# How can I set this up in my game? #
The project will be a git submodule within it's own namespace. The initial implementation shown in Github 
may use the namespace of my personal project.
